Usage
-----

Simple:  

```sh
    json-diff a.json b.json
```

Detailed:  

```sh
    % json-diff --help

    Usage: json-diff [-vCjfonskKp] first.json second.json

    Arguments:
    <first.json>          Old file
    <second.json>         New file

    General options:
    -v, --verbose         Output progress info
    -C, --[no-]color      Colored output
    -j, --raw-json        Display raw JSON encoding of the diff
    -f, --full            Include the equal sections of the document, not just the deltas
        --max-elisions COUNT  Max number of ...s to show in a row in "deltas" mode (before
                                collapsing them)

    -o, --output-keys KEYS  Always print this comma separated keys, with their value, if they are
                            part of an object with any diff

    -x, --exclude-keys KEYS  Exclude these comma separated keys from comparison on both files

    -n, --output-new-only   Output only the updated and new key/value pairs (without marking them as
                            such). If you need only the diffs from the old file, just exchange the
                            first and second json.

    -s, --sort            Sort primitive values in arrays before comparing
    -k, --keys-only       Compare only the keys, ignore the differences in values
    -K, --keep-unchanged-values   Instead of omitting values that are equal, output them as they are
    -p, --precision DECIMALS  Round all floating point numbers to this number of decimal places prior
                                to comparison

    -h, --help            Display this usage information
```

In javascript (ES5):  

```js
    var jsonDiff = require('json-diff')
    
    console.log(jsonDiff.diffString({ foo: 'bar' }, { foo: 'baz' }));
    // Output:
    //  {
    // -  foo: "bar"
    // +  foo: "baz"
    //  }
    
    // As above, but without console colors
    console.log(jsonDiff.diffString({ foo: 'bar' }, { foo: 'baz' }, {color:false}));
    
    // Raw output:
    console.log(jsonDiff.diff({ foo: 'bar', b:3}, { foo: 'baz', b:3}));
    // Output:
    // { foo: { __old: 'bar', __new: 'baz' } }

    // Passing in the "full" option:
    console.log(jsonDiff.diff({ foo: 'bar', b:3}, { foo: 'baz', b:3}, {full:true}));
    // Output:
    // { foo: { __old: 'bar', __new: 'baz' }, b: 3 }
```

In javascript (ES6+):  

```js
    import { diffString, diff } from 'json-diff';
    
    console.log(diffString({ foo: 'bar' }, { foo: 'baz' }));
    console.log(diff({ foo: 'bar' }, { foo: 'baz' }));
```

Features
--------

* colorized, diff-like output
* fuzzy matching of modified array elements (when array elements are object hierarchies)
* "keysOnly" option to compare only the json structure (keys), ignoring the values
* "full" option to output the entire json tree, not just the deltas
* "outputKeys" option to always output the given keys for an object that has differences
* reasonable test coverage (far from 100%, though)

Output Language in Raw-json mode ("full" mode)
--------

### ARRAYS

Unless two arrays are equal, all array elements are transformed into 2-tuple arrays:
* The first element is a one character string denoting the equality ('+', '-', '~', ' ')
* The second element is the old (-), new (+), altered sub-object (~), or unchanged (' ') value  

```sh
    json-diff.js --full --raw-json <(echo '[1,7,3]') <(echo '[1,2,3]')
         [ [ " ", 1 ], [ "-", 7 ], [ "+", 2 ], [ " ", 3 ] ]
```

```sh
    json-diff.js --full --raw-json <(echo '[1,["a","b"],4]') <(echo '[1,["a","c"],4]')
         [ [ " ", 1 ], [ "~", [ [ " ", "a" ], [ "-", "b" ], [ "+", "c" ] ] ], [ " ", 4 ] ]
```
* If two arrays are equal, they are left as is.

### OBJECTS

**Object property values:**  
* If equal, they are left as is
* Unequal scalar values are replaced by an object containing the old and new value:  

```sh
    json-diff.js --full  --raw-json <(echo '{"a":4}') <(echo '{"a":5}')
        { "a": { "__old": 4, "__new": 5 } }
``` 
* Unequal arrays and objects are replaced by their diff:
```sh
    json-diff.js --full  --raw-json <(echo '{"a":[4,5]}') <(echo '{"a":[4,6]}')
        { "a": [ [ " ", 4 ], [ "-", 5 ], [ "+", 6 ] ] }
```

**Object property keys:**  

* Object keys that are deleted or added between two objects are marked as such:
```sh
    json-diff.js --full  --raw-json <(echo '{"a":[4,5]}') <(echo '{"b":[4,5]}')
        { "a__deleted": [ 4, 5 ], "b__added": [ 4, 5 ] }
    json-diff.js --full  --raw-json <(echo '{"a":[4,5]}') <(echo '{"b":[4,6]}')
        { "a__deleted": [ 4, 5 ], "b__added": [ 4, 6 ] }
```

## Non-full mode

* In regular, delta-only (non-"full") mode, equal properties and values are omitted:

```sh
    json-diff.js --raw-json <(echo '{"a":4, "b":6}') <(echo '{"a":5,"b":6}')
        { "a": { "__old": 4, "__new": 5 } }
```

* Equal array elements are represented by a one-tuple containing only a space " ":

```sh
    json-diff.js --raw-json <(echo '[1,7,3]') <(echo '[1,2,3]')
        [ [ " " ], [ "-", 7 ], [ "+", 2 ], [ " " ] ]
```
